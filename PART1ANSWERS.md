1. What is a URL shortening system?

A URL shortening system allows users to input a website's address and obtain a shorter version of it. When someone attempts to access the shortened URL, the system redirects them to the original website.

2. What's the main value? Who needs such a system and why?

Everyone can benefit from this system, as it allows people to easily share URLs with friends. Certain professions, such as influencers, content creators, and businesses, can gain additional advantages. They can use analytics to understand how their audience interacts with their URLs and share links on social media more efficiently, taking up less space.

3. Describe The main mechanism of work and system components.

First, the user inputs the URL that needs to be shortened. The system then generates and returns a shortened URL as a response. To facilitate this, we need a user interface with an input form and a section to display the shortened URL. Additionally, we can include a table to display all URLs.

When the user submits a URL, the backend validates the URL, checks if it already exists in the database, and if not, creates a shortened version and saves it. When someone clicks on the shortened URL, the backend retrieves the corresponding long URL from the database and redirects the user to the original website.

4. What do you think are the main challenges in implementing and running the
system

In this system, scalability is a critical consideration. What if, in the future, our app is used by millions of users?

One problem we might encounter is increased search times for URLs in the database. A potential solution could be to implement a caching layer or to use sharding (partitioning the table) to improve performance.

Additionally, we must ensure that our generated URL keys are unique to avoid overlaps.

Security is also important. We need to prevent the system from being exploited for malicious activities.

5. Try to suggest some ideas for advanced features.

Track and save information about when a shortened URL is accessed, including the timestamp, browser used, and IP address. Use this data to generate analytics for users.

Provide options for both permanent and temporary URLs. For example, users should be able to create temporary short URLs that expire after a specified duration.

Additionally, offer functionality for users to create a dedicated page where they can group and share multiple links.
